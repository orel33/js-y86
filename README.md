# js-y86

js-y86 is an assembler and simulator written in Javascript. It supports:

* All of the original y86 instructions plus cmovX
* Breakpoints via `brk`
* Step-by-step execution
* Inspect the contents of the registers, flags, and memory after every instruction
* Manually pause if you get stuck in an infinite loop
* Syntax highlighting
* See your (hopefully useful) compile errors as you type

[See it in action](https://xsznix.github.io/js-y86/) or [read the documentation on the Wiki](https://github.com/xsznix/js-y86/wiki).
